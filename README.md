DESCRIPTION: An Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker helps users understand their health conditions 
by analyzing symptoms and providing probable causes, preventive advice, and care recommendations. 
It retrieves verified medical data, symptom databases, and guidelines from trusted sources like WHO, 
government health portals, and medical journals. 
Users can input symptoms in natural language such as “I have a sore throat and fever,” and the agent 
provides possible conditions, urgency level, home remedies, and when to consult a doctor. 
It supports multi-language interaction and avoids self-diagnosis risks by offering educational and 
referral-based suggestions. 
This AI-driven assistant promotes early detection, reduces misinformation, and empowers users to take 
informed health actions.
